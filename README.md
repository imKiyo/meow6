TO DO:

- <s>unique mosaic view of all the present gifs deppended of its sizes</s>
- <s>if multiple images are being uploaded then each gif should have its own tags to fill</s>
- <s>allow upload of gifs through the link?</s>
- <s>gif buttons from the preview should be moved to the bottom in a cleaner way</s>
- <s>clean header</s> and make it consistent
- gif details should popout on the same page in a smaller window when you leftclick instead of its own page(?)
- shortcut to highlight searchbar
- remember the current search and mby scroll position so going back would not reset the view to top
- figure out whats the best file format for storage
- make it convert the non .gif files to .gif if attempted to upload
- add checks for users for if they can access the domain and if can upload or rate the gifs
- allow admin marked users to delete other user gifs and apply suspensions on them
- user collections
- gif visibilities
- user groups? for sharing files
- <s>account settings</s>
  - dark mode option (im already blind) # almost done
  - autoplay every gif seen?
  - <s>nsfw visibility toggle</s>
- stresstest many gifs on a single side and decide if any optimalization steps are further needed
- more secure checks and usage limits/cd's?
